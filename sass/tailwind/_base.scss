// tailwind/_base.scss
// Comprehensive Guide

/*
This file is part of your Tailwind CSS setup and is used to extend or customize the base styles of Tailwind. Here's how to use it effectively:

1. What is `@layer base`:
   - The `@layer base` directive allows you to inject your custom styles into the base layer of Tailwind CSS.
   - The base layer is processed first and includes styles like normalize.css and default styles for HTML elements.

2. How to Use:
   - Inside the `@layer base { ... }` block, you can define your custom styles.
   - These styles should typically be global styles or resets that you want to apply broadly across your application.

3. Example Usage:
   - Resetting default styles:
     ```
     @layer base {
       h1 {
         margin-top: 0;
       }
       p {
         line-height: 1.5;
       }
     }
     ```
   - Adding global styles:
     ```
     @layer base {
       body {
         font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
       }
       a {
         color: #3490dc;
         text-decoration: none;
       }
     }
     ```

4. Best Practices:
   - Keep the styles in this file minimal and global in nature.
   - Avoid overriding Tailwind's utility classes here; use custom components or utilities for that purpose.

By organizing your global and reset styles in the `tailwind/_base.scss`, you maintain a clean and structured approach to your project's styling.
