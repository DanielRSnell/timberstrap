// tailwind/_utils.scss
// Comprehensive Guide

/*
The `tailwind/_utils.scss` file is an integral part of your Tailwind CSS project, focusing on defining custom utility classes. Here's a guide to effectively use this file:

1. Purpose of `@layer utilities`:
   - The `@layer utilities` directive is used to create custom utility classes in Tailwind CSS.
   - This layer is processed after the components layer, allowing these utilities to override both base and component styles if needed.

2. How to Use:
   - Inside the `@layer utilities { ... }` block, you define your custom utility classes.
   - These utilities are meant to be single-purpose classes that can be applied to HTML elements for specific styling needs.

3. Example Usage:
   - Creating a margin utility:
     ```
     @layer utilities {
       .margin-md {
         margin: 1rem;
       }
     }
     ```
   - Defining a text utility:
     ```
     @layer utilities {
       .text-shadow {
         text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
       }
     }
     ```
   - Adding responsive utilities:
     ```
     @layer utilities {
       @media (min-width: 768px) {
         .lg-text-center {
           text-align: center;
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. Best Practices:
   - Use this file for single-purpose, reusable utility classes, not for component styles or global styles.
   - Keep your utility classes simple and focus on one function per class.
   - Consider using Tailwind's configuration file to extend existing utilities or add new ones, leveraging Tailwind's built-in responsive and state variants.

The `tailwind/_utils.scss` file helps you maintain a clean and organized codebase by separating your custom utility classes, ensuring they are easily accessible and reusable across your project.
