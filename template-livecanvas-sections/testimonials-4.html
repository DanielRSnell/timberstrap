            "When building projects, going from an idea to a working version is
            crucial. Broke.dev's components have been extremely useful for
            quickly mocking up a landing page. I can now focus more time on my
            app, and less time worrying about the first impression my project
            will get. I really love the attention to detail in these blocks.
            Michael has always impressed me with the quality he produces."
