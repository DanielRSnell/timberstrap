                          Broke Componentsis legally required to complete what is called a KYC
                            (Know Your Customer) Survey for every user that signs up, which
                            includes completing identity verification for the person who
                            chooses to be the owner, administrator, and representative of a
                            Broke Componentsaccount. These requirements are intended to promote
                            transparency and prevent individuals from using complex company
                            structures to hide terrorist financing, money laundering, tax
                            evasion, and other financial crimes. Usually, we are able to
                            verify our users' identities automatically, but once in a while we
                            are unable to and have to reach out for more information.

                          Reserves are utilized to keep processing volume available within
                            your Broke Componentsaccount to fund refunds or chargebacks. There are
                            several possible reasons a reserve may be placed at onboarding. It
                            could be that your business operates in an industry or with a
                            business model that potentially creates additional credit risk,
                            even if you are not yet receiving chargebacks. Some businesses may
                            also collect payment far in advance, creating additional risk.
                            Most reserves are temporary, however, and we are happy to revisit
                            if you provide additional information by replying to the
                            notification email you received.
